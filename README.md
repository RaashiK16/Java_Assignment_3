# Java_Assignment_3

The file EmployeeManagementSystem.java contains the code for the question in assignment 3. I have created a program which takes the information about employees as inputs from both the console and text file (employees.txt in this case) and writes the data into a file. This program uses three different files (fte_log.txt, intern_log.txt, contractor_log.txt) to store the data of different types of employees.

The same has been demonstrated below


## Demo

Following is the set of inputs that I gave to my program.

Here I have entered the data of one FTE, one intern and one contractor.

Here are the resuts that we obtain in the respective files - (fte_log.txt, intern_log.txt, contractor_log.txt)

Hence we can see that the data has been successfully stored.
